# About hello.c :wave:

This is the first program I wrote in C. It just gets an input from the user such as a name and prints "Hello, *name*" on the screen.

## Main variables: :a:

There's only one variable called **name** responsible for saving the name input of the user.

## Libraries: :books:

This program only uses two libraries:

- **cs50.h** : CS50's main library with get input functions.
- **stdio.h**: Standard IO, which IÂ´ll use the functions printf to print  strings on the screen.
