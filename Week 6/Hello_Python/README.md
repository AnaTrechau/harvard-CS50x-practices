# About Hello :wave:

Technically, this is not the first program I wrote in Python, but it's the first I did for CS50 hehe. To start, this is just a simple program that gets user input and says "Hello, name."

## Main variables: :abc:

There's only one variable called **name** responsible for saving the name input of the user.

## Libraries: :books:

Since Python is a little bit easier than C, I decided not to use the get_input functions built in the CS50 library.
