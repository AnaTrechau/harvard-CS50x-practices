## About my project :heart:

For problem set 0, I had to follow the requirements bellow and create a project on Scratch.

- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via **Make a Block**), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196) and [Ivy’s Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433).

I decided to make a bossfight based on [Undertale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/), using all I learned during class 0.

### How the game works :space_invader:

Just like in Undertale, you won´t have to kill doggo, try becoming his friend instead. :dog2:

**You can access this game through the link:**

You can check all the programming logic applied clicking on the "see inside" button on the top right.

### Instructions: ⌨️

**Waking up doggo:** Left click

**Choosing options:** Type according to the option

**Heart movement:** Use keyboard arrows
