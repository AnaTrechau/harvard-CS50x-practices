# About CS50x and this repository :bulb:

## What is CS50x? :eyes:

This is **CS50x** , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, **CS50x** teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of **CS50x** , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.

## Repository objective :dart:

I created this repository in order to keep track of my evolution after I finish CS50x. It contains all codes I had to submit for practice.

### How this repository is divided :card_index_dividers:

Just like CS50x, this repository is divided by weeks, starting at week 0 of course.

**Weekly content:**

***Week 0: Scratch***

In week 0 we got familiar with what is computer science, how computers represents numbers using binary and how to solve problems with algorithms.

- **Problem set 0:** Consists of creating a project of your like on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). Here you´ll find the **doggo bossfight**.

***Week 1: C***

In week one we´re introduced to our first programming language, C. We learn about data types, operators, loops, conditionals and other basic structures.

- **Problem set 1:** Is about translating the problem solving we did in pseudocode to C. We get problems like **Mario** and **Cash**.

***Week 2: Arrays***

We dive deeply on data types, specifically strings and arrays (there´s a plot twist there). We also learn about C main function, command-line inputs and debugging.

- **Problem set 2:** As week 2´s definition says, we work a lot with arrays here. Here you´ll find codes like **Scrabble**, **Readability** and **Caesar**.

***Week : Algorithms***

On week 3 we learn about searching and sorting algorithms like: linear search, binary search, selection sort, bubble sort and merge sort.

- **Problem set 3:** On these exercises we'll get to implement a lot of functions, which is great to train code understanding and implementing. Here you´ll find codes like **Sort**, **Plurality** and **Runoff**.
